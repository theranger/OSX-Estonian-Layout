# Estonian Keyboard Layout for OS X
This repository contains Estonian keyboard layout for OS X operating system. It was created because the default layout still misses some (dead) keys. All fluff, fuzz and bloat were also removed leaving only standard symbols as used in Estonian layouts under Windows and Linux.

This layout is intended to be used with a traditional ISO-style keyboards with 101/102 keys.

## Installation
1. Keyboard layout files for each user are stored in `Library/Keyboard layouts` under user's home directory. Copy the file `Estonian.keylayout` into that directory. You may have to log out and in again so that OS X will find the file.

2. Open `System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources`. Using a `+`-sign, add Estonian keyboard layout from `Others` list. Note that this custom layout does not have a flag associated with it. It is intentional and helps to distinguish this layout from the official one.

3. Select new layout from the language bar.

## Customization
This layout is modified and cleaned up using [Ukelele] (http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) keyboard layout editor software. Feel free to update it according to your needs.
